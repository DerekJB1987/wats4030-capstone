    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm a senior business analyst at Boeing and am looking to enter into a web development role. 
      I have worked at Boeing for over 6 years and always visualized becoming part of the tech industry growing in my hometown of Seattle.
      I recently completed a web development certificate program at Seattle University and added experience using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs and additional skills showcased by the personal projects in my portfolio. 
      My prior work experience allows me to understand office dynamics while still effectively working in teams to complete projects on time and increasing the efficiency of standard processes.
      I am passionate about opportunities that allow me to continually learn and practice my skills while making a difference for others and myself.</p>
