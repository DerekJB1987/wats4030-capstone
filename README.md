# Seattle University Web Development Certificate WATS 4030 Capstone Project

> This project is a display of all of the web development skills I attained during the program from April 2018 to March 2019.

## Project Goals
This project is intended to create a featured item in my portfolio. Along with other projects to show the progression of my skills throughout the program.

I decided to use Vue.js that incorporates HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a webapp powered using data from a third party API. I wanted to make my project to be both fun and have something for everyone. I created five seperate vue files that each hosted a seperate API translator: Yoda, Pirate, Vulcan, Shakespeare, and Dothraki. The Fun Translations API is predominately all science-fiction and fantasy themed. 

## Basic Requirements
In order to successfully complete this project, we must fulfill the following
requirements. The requirements below are organized according to the file we will
modify to fulfill them.

* Come up with an idea for a web project that fits with your career goals and skill set.
* Express your plans to complete the project using wireframes, design comps, palettes, and other planning documents.
* Create a development environment suitable for working with your chosen technology.
* Use standards-compliant HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
* Provide a usable experience across modern web browsers (including the latest versions of Edge/IE, Chrome, Safari, Firefox) and mobile experiences (including iOS and Android browsers).
* Provide a usable experience for users who require assistive technologies.
* Implement at least one significant feature or layout powered by JavaScript.
* Implement at least one third party data API to receive data used in the project. (This can be a data API implemented or deployed by you, or something created by an external provider.)
* Create a user friendly information architecture that allows users to easily accomplish their goals within your project.
* Create an elegant and engaging visual design so users have a more enjoyable experience with your project.
* Implement a third party analytics solution so user behavior can be tracked and monitored.
* Deploy the project consistently to a publicly accessible server throughout the development process so your work can be reviewed on a regular basis.

## How to Use my Project

My website is simple to use, all you have to do is click the following link <a href="http://derekbenak.com/wats4030-capstone/#/"></a> that will take you directly to my project. Then click on the Vue router-link for the theme that interests you most and enter a phrase that you want to see translated into that specific language. Fun Translations does have 60 API calls a day with distribution of 5 calls an hour to maintain their service level.
